## Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (Prettier configuration)
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Aim for good test coverage

### Performance

- SafeMotion prioritizes performance and accessibility
- Test on mobile devices and low-end hardware
- Respect user preferences (reduced motion, battery level)

### Accessibility

- All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels
- Test with screen readers when applicable
